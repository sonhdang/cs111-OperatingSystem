QUESTION 2.1.1 - causing conflicts:
Why does it take many iterations before errors are seen?
Why does a significantly smaller number of iterations so seldom fail?
Because computers are generally really fast. One instructions can be executed in
a few nano seconds. Therefore, most operations will be able to run to finish before
another operation runs. However, there will still be a small percentage of operations
being executed in race condition. Since the probability of that happening is small, 
we might only see it if we do it many many times. A small number of iteration might
not produce the outcome of the rarer events since there is a higher chance of the
usual event happening (no race condition). This is analogous to The Law of Large 
Numbers in the field of Statistics.
